    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will implement a simple feed-forward neural network using PyTorch, a straight-forward and simple-to-pickup framework for quickly prototyping deep learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides 2 powerful things. First, a nice data structure called Tensor (basically a matrix, similar to Numpy ndarray). Tensor is optimized for matrix calculation and can be loaded to a GPU. Tensor is also implemented so that it's easy to calculate and pass back chains of gradients, which is extremely useful for backpropagation on neural network. Second, a nice inner mechanism called Autograd that nicely map variables involved a chain of calculations and efficiently calculate their gradients via the chain rule when needed. Read more here: https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-autograd-understanding-the-heart-of-pytorchs-magic-2686cd94ec95  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will train and evaluate the model on a simple dataset for classifying seeds. The dataset has 7 features and 3 labels. Refer to the example from the discussion session if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this problem, you are given a good amount of freedom in tweaking your choices in designing the network. As long as it's still a feed-forward network, it's fine. Accuracy does not matter as long as it's reasonable (like above 80%) but do try to achieve a high accuracy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(Optional): the dataset provided to you is very simple. Instead, you can challenge yourself by trying more difficult datasets. Some datasets that you can loaded directly using PyTorch:\n",
    "- MNIST (Most famous dataset for getting into Deep Learning)\n",
    "- Fashion-MNIST\n",
    "- Kuzushiji-MNIST \n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are available at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html. You will get the same grade no matter what dataset you use. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part a\n",
    "Firstly, load and inspect the dataset from \"seeds_dataset.csv\". Split them into a train set (90%) and a test set (10%). You should be quite comfortable with these operations by now. "

    "Now we are going to use the `GridSearch` function from `fairlearn.reductions` to try to mitigate this statistical parity discrepancy. This is one of the many ways to achieve this. What this function does is it gives higher weights to certain datapoints (determined by the sensitive feature) in order to change what the model learns. It automatically uses grid search to determine which weight should be given to `SEX==1` datapoints vs `SEX==2` datapoints (if you're interested you can read the source code). While it is called grid search, the space it searches is 1-dimensional. For our purposes, `GridSearch` takes four arguments: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model you defined above. This is a non-keyword argument.\n",

    "3. (Keyword argument) `grid_limit`. This determines the boundaries of the grid search. Basically, the `GridSearch` function will search the interval \\[-`grid_limit`,`grid_limit`\\] to find the weights. Choose this to be 0.8.\n",
    "3. (Keyword argument) `grid_size`. This determines how many points there will be in the grid search. Choose this to be 21.\n",

    "Just like `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` we have seen in HW1, `fairlearn.reductions.GridSearch` is also a wrapper, so you need to call `.fit()` on this wrapper (not the model directly). Training should be done in less than 5 minutes. In the end this wrapper will contain `grid_size` many models, each corresponding to a different weight for datapoints."
